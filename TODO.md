[] How to consume APIs from backend to Frontend


Table - Phase 1

Studies table => content, heading, total applied to study, publisherId

Participant/User => UserId, UserName and details(dob etc), user Email, Notes, ConsentForm if needed, profile photo, Eligible or not, status
User-Study Id => store multiple studies if possible.
Pipeline - Applied, Screening, Enrolled, Completed -> Store UserIds and StudyIds. ( For each study by user there will be seperate Status )
so create study in differnt table and its relation with user along with Status of the study of the user


UserStudy -> add status column, 

Add New Participant (Must be form the registerd User) => Name Email photo,phone,resumeLink => Create this table.

Phase - 2

Schedule, Dashboard
